# Concrete-Compressive-Strength
Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size, as opposed to tensile strength, which withstands loads tending to elongate.
compressive strength is one of the most important engineering properties of concrete. 
It is a standard industrial practice that the concrete is classified based on grades.
 This grade is nothing but the Compressive Strength of the concrete cube or cylinder.
 Cube or Cylinder samples are usually tested under a compression testing machine to obtain the compressive strength of concrete. 
The test requisites differ country to country based on the design code.
The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients .
These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. 
Data is in raw form (not scaled).
The compressive strength of concrete can be calculated by the failure load divided with the cross sectional area resisting
 the load and reported in pounds per square inch in US customary units and mega pascals (MPa) in SI units. 
Concrete's compressive strength requirements can vary from 2500 psi (17 MPa) for residential concrete to 4000psi (28 MPa) 
and higher in commercial structures. Higher strengths upto and exceeding 10,000 psi (70 MPa) are specified for certain applications.
